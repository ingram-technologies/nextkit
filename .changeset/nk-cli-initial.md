"@ingram-tech/nk-cli": minor

New package: `nk`, the nextkit CLI. `nk dev` starts Next and boots local Supabase first (wiring its env in) when `supabase/config.toml` is present — replacing per-site `dev.sh`. Adds `nk format` (Biome for code, Prettier for SQL — bundled, so Prettier never lands in app deps), plus `lint` / `check` / `type-check` / `build`. The code formatter sits behind a small indirection so it can move to oxc later via `{ "nk": { "formatter": "oxc" } }`.
